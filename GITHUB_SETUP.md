# GitHub Setup Guide for Battery Dashboard

## Steps to Deploy to GitHub

### 1. Create a GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the **"+"** icon in the top right corner
3. Select **"New repository"**
4. Configure your repository:
   - **Repository name**: `battery-dashboard` (or your preferred name)
   - **Description**: "B2B E-commerce platform for custom-engraved FlexVolt batteries with QR theft protection"
   - **Visibility**: Choose **Private** or **Public**
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
5. Click **"Create repository"**

### 2. Connect Your Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these in your terminal:

```bash
# Add GitHub as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/battery-dashboard.git

# Verify remote was added
git remote -v

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. If You Use SSH Instead of HTTPS

If you prefer SSH (recommended for regular use):

```bash
# Add GitHub as remote origin with SSH
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/battery-dashboard.git

# Push your code
git push -u origin main
```

### 4. Set Up GitHub Secrets for Deployment

If you want to continue using Vercel deployment, add these secrets in your GitHub repository:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click **Settings** ‚Üí **Secrets and variables** ‚Üí **Actions**
3. Add these secrets:
   - `VERCEL_TOKEN` - Get from https://vercel.com/account/tokens
   - `VERCEL_ORG_ID` - Found in your Vercel project settings
   - `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` - Found in your Vercel project settings

### 5. Create a README for GitHub

Create a `README.md` file in the root:

```markdown

```

### 7. Recommended GitHub Settings

Once your repo is on GitHub:

1. **Branch Protection** (Settings ‚Üí Branches):
   - Protect the `main` branch
   - Require pull request reviews
   - Dismiss stale reviews
   - Require status checks

2. **GitHub Actions** (Optional):

   - Create a Project board for feature planning

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Permission Denied (publickey)
If you get this error with SSH:
```bash
# Test your SSH connection
ssh -T git@github.com

# If it fails, set up SSH keys:
# https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh
```

### Large Files Warning
If you get warnings about large files:
```bash
# Check file sizes
find . -size +100M -type f

# Consider using Git LFS for large files
git lfs track "*.mp4"
```

### Existing Repository
If you already have a repository and want to change the remote:
```bash
# Remove existing remote
git remote remove origin

# Add new remote
git remote add origin YOUR_NEW_REPOSITORY_URL
```

## Next Steps

1. Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD
2. Configure branch protection rules
3. Add collaborators if working with a team
4. Set up GitHub Pages for documentation (optional)
5. Configure webhooks for deployment notifications

## Security Notes

- Never commit `.env.local` or other environment files
- Use GitHub Secrets for sensitive variables
- Enable 2FA on your GitHub account
- Regularly review repository access
